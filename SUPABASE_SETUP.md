const supabaseKey = 'YOUR_ANON_KEY_HERE'
```

## Step 5: Update Your HTML

Replace the placeholder values in your `index.html` file:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Supabase not initialized" error**
   - Check that your credentials are correct
   - Make sure the Supabase SDK is loaded

2. **Upload fails**
   - Verify your storage bucket is created and public
   - Check browser console for error messages

3. **Files don't load**
   - Verify your database table was created
   - Check that RLS policies are set correctly

### Security Notes:
